Day was a driving force behind the creation of the BB&C program. When she first arrived at Whitman as a student in 2001, she planned to major in Biology. But a sophomore-year Psychology class changed her plans.

“I was still very committed to the Biology path,” Day says, “but by taking Psychology, I realized there was so much that biology could explain about behavior. I really wanted to explore that intersection between biology and psychology.”

Day considered her options, from minoring in Psychology to building her own major. Ultimately, she decided to double-major in both Biology and Psychology. 

“While I think that was a good decision, it’s not a decision I would make again,” she says. “It’s a lot of work. I had to take all the classes for Biology and all the classes for Psychology. I had to do two thesis projects, two sets of oral exams and written exams. My senior year was not a ton of fun.”

Day went on to earn her doctorate in Neuroscience from the University of Minnesota. And when a faculty position opened at Whitman in 2019, she was eager to return to help train the scientists of tomorrow—and even better, to create a new path for them to study neuroscience as undergrads.

“I made it a mission,” says Day. “I didn’t want students to have to double-major. I knew there was another way to do this.”
