Last week was one of the most exciting of the year as we welcomed over 400 new students, consisting of 390 first-years and 30 transfer students. With the help of our campus community, we had a vibrant week for the Class of 2028 as they got settled in their new-found home at Whitman.

We had the pleasure of greeting this unique class with distinct experiences and diverse passions—hailing from around the country, the continent and the globe.

This incoming class includes students from 33 states, 43 countries, four tribal nations and several from right here in the Walla Walla Valley. Made up of 17% international students, 29% students of color and 21% who are in the first-generation of their family to attend college, this class is yet another that is breaking barriers at Whitman.

We also welcomed nine Posse scholars from Chicago and three Šináata Scholars from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, both new partnerships with the college that will continue to flourish over time.

The curiosity, energy, creativity and grit that the Class of 2028 has shown in their short time as Whitties is exciting and inspiring to see. We cannot wait to witness what they may do over the next few years!
