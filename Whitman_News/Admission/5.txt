Thirty years ago, in October 1994, a Whitman tradition began when an enterprising first-year, Dianne Weghorst ’98, decided to put on the first fall screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show”—a 1975 musical comedy horror film known for its campy style, colorful characters and enthusiastic audience participation.  

The spooky-season tradition stuck—and for the next three decades, Whitties embraced the weird and wacky show year after year with few exceptions. Old issues of student newspapers show the consistent enthusiasm generations of Whitman students have had for the tradition.
