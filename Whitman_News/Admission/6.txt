Pre-registration for Fall 2025 starts next Friday! You can get a head start by granting Faculty Consent and Prerequisite Waivers for students who have already contacted you about needing one of these permissions in order to join your class. Instructions for granting them are attached below.

Waitlists will open at 8:00 AM on Wed, May 1. At that time, all continuing students will be able to add themselves to the waitlist for closed sections. Waitlists remain open until the pre-registration period ends at 11:59 PM on the last day of the Spring semester (Tue, May 20). Waitlists for Fall 2025 classes will not reopen after that; during the Add/Drop period at the start of the Fall semester, students can register themselves for any open seats on a first come, first served basis.

Finally, if you haven't already done so, please double check the Fall 2025 course schedule spreadsheet to confirm your section info is correct, including seat reservations, faculty consent, course times, waitlist preferences, and course fees. You will have the opportunity to submit your classroom preferences after students' pre-registration appointments and before the end of the semester.
If you need to make any changes to a section, please mark it "Not OK" in the spreadsheet and leave a note specifying what needs to be updated.
If you need to request any new sections that are not yet on the schedule, please do so via the "Request new 2025FA sections here" tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet. I will make the requested changes as soon as possible and let you know once your request has been processed.
