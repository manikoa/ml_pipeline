Happy Fall everyone! I hope you are enjoying the changing weather and colors.

I was one of six members of the Alumni Association Board who enjoyed a wonderful time in Walla Walla for Reunion Weekend, September 21-24. We had the opportunity to assist the hardworking Alumni Relations team in hosting over 600 alumni and friends, spanning the class years from 1958 to 2019.

Thirteen classes attended 35 events over four days. We had the pleasure to engage with alumni from all those classes; learn more about what is currently happening on campus from staff, faculty, and students; get an update on the Collegeâ€™s initiatives from President Bolton; and even got to guest-DJ one of the class parties on Saturday night.

One of the best-attended events of the weekend was our student-alumni networking event, Whitties Helping Whitties. More than 100 alumni met with 56 students for career conversation and connection on the Cordiner Hall patio, taking the first steps in building an alumni network to help ensure a strong graduate launch.

Reunion Convocation was another highlight, where we welcomed alumni from all classes and our 10th, 25th and 40th reunion committee members presented their fundraising results. It was poignant to hear their reasons why supporting Whitman is so important to them, and gratifying to see the way our reunion classes supported our current and future students.

Thanks to the alumni who were able to attend the reunion weekend, and thanks to the Alumni Relations Office for their tireless efforts to create such a successful event.
