What a joy it has been to launch Upward Together over the past three weeks. Following amazing celebrations on Ankeny Field and in key cities, anticipation is building for our November 8 Seattle T-Mobile Park event, featuring a conversation with Mariners Chairman John Stanton ‘77 and serial entrepreneur Jonathan Sposato ‘89.  

We are bowled over by magical moments capturing the collective spirit of the Whitman community.  Have you seen the video highlights of Drew Shoals ‘05, Amazon corporate counsel and former drummer of the rock band Train, leading students, alumni, and faculty in an “Upward Together Band” rendition of “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough?” You’ve gotta see it below.  

And of course, we are inspired by the generosity of Whitties.  Just in the past week, 1,534 donors stepped up to support students through All In for Whitman, and we announced a $1.5 million investment in scholarships & aid from Gordon ‘68 and Kathy Britt Keane ‘67.  

We are leading Upward Together out of love for Whitman College, our community, the life-changing student experience we offer, and for how our graduates achieve success and impact throughout the world.  But we envision an even better Whitman of the future.  Realizing it will require climbing some high mountains. We’ll get there, together.
