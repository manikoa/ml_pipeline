Justin Daigneault ’09 (he/they) has been seeking out opportunities to listen, help and build community since first stepping foot on campus at Whitman College. From volunteering as a Peer Listener to working in Residence Life, their experiences in and out of the classroom equipped them with valuable skills that helped them find their path. Now, he’s grateful for the opportunity to make a living doing something he’s passionate about: providing behavioral health services to underrepresented children and youth.
