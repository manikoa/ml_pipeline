Before they ever met, Amy Ly ’06 and Steven Ly ’07 were on the same page about what they wanted in a college: a top-notch education and the opportunity to play college sports. They found what they were looking for—and each other—at Whitman College.

Amy majored in Biology and played soccer for two years and tennis for one at Whitman. Steven, also a Biology major, played on the men’s tennis team all four years. The couple, who met as students, developed deep connections with fellow students and faculty that remain strong to this day. They have expressed their gratitude for their Whitman experience by making annual gifts to the college for more than two decades.

“I worked for the Development Office for a year after graduating, and I came to understand the importance of alumni giving,” says Amy, who notes that she would not have been able to attend Whitman without the generous scholarships and aid she received. “We primarily give to support programs that we really enjoyed, such as the tennis teams and the Whitman in China program, as well as general scholarships through The Whitman Fund. It’s our way of paying it forward.”
