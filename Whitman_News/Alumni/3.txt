It’s finals week at Whitman, and all will soon be quiet as many of our students return home for holiday break.  

The end of the semester is a good time to reflect on some amazing community events that occurred in the past month. We celebrated our Seattle Upward Together launch at T-Mobile Park and announced the naming of Robart Hall in honor of Judge Jim Robart ‘69. And Whitman partnered with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) to host the inaugural Pášx̣apa Powwow.

With gratitude for all donors of gifts of all sizes, we’re recognizing a secure listing of alumni donors by class to accompany a link to the recently mailed Donor Annual Report.

We’re also gearing up for a big start to 2024 with Upward Together events in New York and Washington, DC and Whitties Helping Whitties throughout the West Coast.

Read all about this and more below. Thank you for all that you continue to do for Whitman. Best wishes for the holiday season!
