Commencement always brings a meaningful cap to the academic year as we celebrate our graduating seniors and welcome them into the alumni community.

The New York Times technology reporter Cecilia Kang ‘94 delivered an inspiring address, calling the class of 2024 “the greatest comeback kids in history” and encouraging them to “double down on their humanness” in the face of rising AI. We know a Whitman education provides a strong foundation for doing just that.

We’re grateful for the generosity of Matt Osborne ‘93 and the late George Osborne ‘66 for their Upward Together Campaign philanthropy to strengthen community and residential life through health and safety investments in our fraternity chapter houses. The Osbornes are among 14,053 valued donors making an impact for students through gifts of all sizes to the Upward Together Campaign.

Summer is quiet on our campus, but it’s a time of anticipation to renew our work of preparing young people to be the leaders and thinkers our communities need. You make this good work possible. Thank you!
