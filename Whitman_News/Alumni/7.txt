Don Amsbaugh ’91 and Kim Amsbaugh ’90 have been fond of Whitman College since they first met on campus over three decades ago. As members of Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta, respectively, the Amsbaughs value a liberal arts education and know what it means to make lifelong connections and memories at Whitman. Their support of Upward Together exemplifies their 29 years of giving as recurring donors. Boosting Scholarships and Student Aid, as well as unrestricted giving, has allowed them to make a meaningful impact on the Whitman community since the time of their own commencement.

Don graduated from Whitman with a degree in History. Kim earned her degree in English and went on to receive a Master of Arts in Journalism from the University of Arizona. The Amsbaughs reside in Palo Alto, California, and are parents to Sherwin ’21, Charlotte and Ritter—also graduates from liberal arts institutions.
