At Whitman, we stand on the shoulders of the good work and generosity of generations of alumni, faculty, and staff who went before us. In this newsletter, we’re proud to celebrate the decades of service of John ’85 and Shauna Lilly Bogley ’83 with an announcement of a new scholarship endowment bearing their names.  

Additionally, as Whitman faculty continue to create innovation in our academic program, we’re excited to share news of a new minor in law, culture and the humanities.  

Beyond the classroom, our women’s basketball team is on a roll: 20-1 and ranked #6 nationally in the latest d3hoops.com poll.  Join us in following the Blues to victory as March Madness approaches.

At Whitman, there are so many reasons to be grateful.  Thank you for all that you do to help our students prepare to be the leaders and thinkers our communities and the world need.
