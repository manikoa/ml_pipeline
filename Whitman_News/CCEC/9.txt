On Thursday, October 10, Whitman is honored to host an important regional convening to think and plan together for the long term health and use of our watershed. You are invited to be a part of this!

Below you can find more details and an event flyer is attached to this note. Because this is taking place over 4-Day we wanted to provide as much advance notice as possible in case this opportunity might impact your plans during that long weekend.

CC'ing event hosts Alle Brown-Law and Amanda Cronin '01 if you want to follow up directly with them (I'm happy to try to be helpful, too).  Thanks!
