Tomorrow (Thursday) is the deadline to sign up to volunteer at next Saturday's 2nd annual Pášx̣apa Powwow.  Please use the form on this website to indicate your interest and availability and one of the planning committee members will be in touch with you soon. 

** If you would like to volunteer with a club or a residence hall section or a group of friends please write me back and we can figure out the options so that you can all do that together,

Many thanks for your commitment to this very special celebration of tribal presence in our region!
