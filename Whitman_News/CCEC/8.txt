If this week’s extraordinary series of events, discussions, performances, and convenings for the Power and Privilege Symposium sparked a desire in you to take action, please consider turning your idea into a proposal for this year’s Ben Rabinowitz Prize, worth $3500.

Many of the topics explored this week could be the focus of projects for a Rabinowitz Award, the purpose of which is to increase compassion in health care or politics. ALL of these subjects, and so many others discussed throughout the Symposium, can let you make positive change in the world.

If you want to reclaim hope and think the Rabinowitz Prize can help you do that, there is a short application which is due Wednesday March 12 that you can download here.

I am happy to answer questions via email or an in-person conversation if that would be helpful. Also, one of last year’s winners, Caine Ryan ‘26, is happy to talk with students who want to know more about what this Award can allow.

Many thanks to all the leaders, organizers, coaches, and presenters of this year’s Symposium! Super inspiring!
