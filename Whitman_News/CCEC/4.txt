Monday starting at 4:30 the public is invited to give input to the Walla Walla Valley 2050 Metropolitan Transportation Plan. This note is an invitation to be part of an important local initiative.

This community event is organized by the Walla Walla Valley Metropolitan Planning Organization and will take place at the Water and Environmental Center at WW Community College.

It’s worth noting that this is a highly compelling collaboration: members of the metropolitan district are the cities of Walla Walla, College Place, Prescott and Waitsburg, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, Valley Transit, Port of Walla Walla, Walla Walla County, Umatilla County, Washington State Department of Transportation and Oregon Department of Transportation. Great networking opportunities!

I will be taking the CCEC van to this event and have a few seats if anyone would like to participate. I will be leaving outside Reid at 4:10 sharp and we’ll return to campus no later than 7:00 pm. You can reserve a seat in advance or just show up on the corner of Boyer and Park outside Reid by 4:09 Monday.

Please let me know if you have ideas and/or questions about this great opportunity to make your voice heard about the future of our place!

Have a lovely weekend and safe travels as you make your way around campus and town
