This Tuesday at 1:00 pm is the ribbon cutting and Grand Opening for the new public library in Touchet, a small community about 18 miles west of campus. I’m going to attend and will be taking the CCEC van and so I wanted to see if anyone would like to come along. I’m planning to leave the Reid Center at 12:30 and anticipate being back on campus around 2:15-ish.

Does anyone want to join me Tuesday for this celebration of learning and reading?  I’d enjoy company! Please let me know by replying to this note or else just show up at Reid Tuesday at 12:30.
