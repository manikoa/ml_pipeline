As Whitman welcomed the Class of 2028 to campus this fall, the Career and Community Engagement Center (CCEC) realized a goal we’ve been working toward for the last several years. As of this fall, I’m pleased to share that every student at Whitman now has a coach to assist students in developing and pursuing an individualized, comprehensive four-year plan through Whitman and into their post-graduate career path.

While this coaching is essential, it is merely the underpinning for the many steps that students will take as they pursue leadership experiences on- and off-campus, initiate relationships with people and organizations doing work they find interesting, test out classroom learning in internships and research labs, extend their understanding beyond campus borders through study abroad and fellowship experiences, and so much more.

Whitman College has long recognized the critical role of these kinds of off-campus learning opportunities and established the Whitman Internship Grant, empowering students to access valuable internships across various professional fields for over 25 years. This initiative provides financial support for roughly 150 students to pursue high-impact, unpaid internships around the US and globally each year, enhancing their professional growth through meaningful, hands-on experiences.

This financial support, including a gift from Jonathan Sposato ‘89 and Heather Lowenthal featured below, underscores Whitman's commitment to creating connections between academic learning and real-world application, ensuring this essential experience is accessible to all students, regardless of their financial situation. Initiatives like this contribute to cultivating the next generation of leaders, reinforcing Whitman's dedication to student success and career readiness.  I’m grateful to all alumni and families who help make these experiences possible for our students.
